# Usage

## Development

React+Redux front-end development files are served from webpack-dev-server, configured with webpack.config.js, and hot-reloaded automatically on every save.

to start webpack-dev-server run:

	npm run dev

this command will bundle up files for webpack-dev-sever and host them on: 

http://localhost:8080


to start the Node+Express application sourced in the `/api` folder run:

    node server


**_Hot-reloading is only enabled for files in the /src folder. Changes to any files in the /api folder will usually require a server restart_**

## Production	

In development, the bundle is created behind the scenes and is not production ready. The production-ready bundle is served from webpack using the configuration file ~/webpack.config.production.js. To create a production-ready bundle run: 

	npm run deploy

this command will bundle up files and export them to public folder:

	~/public

## Testing your production bundle 

Testing the production bundle can be done by running an express server from server.js in the root directory. To start the server run:

	node server
	
This script will serve your app from the production bundle in the public folder. To access the app go to 

	http://localhost:3000

**_Make sure to terminate the server when finished testing_**

to terminate the express server press `CTRL + c`:

## Automated Programming - CLI Tools

The `setlife.js` file enables convenience tools that generate React components based off the templates in `/src/templates` and `/api/templates`

- Run `npm install -g` to enable `setlife` CLI tools
- `setlife create-component <name>` creates a standard component in /src/components
- Add the option `--redux` or `-r` for Redux-enabled components with `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` functions connected to the component
- Add the option `--style` or `-s` to generate the corresponding stylesheet and add it to the index
---
- `setlife create-model <name>` creates a standard model in /api/models
- Add the option `--type` or `-t` to create the associated Bookshelf-GraphQL Type
